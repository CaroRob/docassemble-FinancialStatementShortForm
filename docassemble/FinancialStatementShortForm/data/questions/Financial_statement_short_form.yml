  * separate support cases,
  * custody cases,
  * child support cases, 
  * hearings that involve division of property, and
  * other financial matters.
  
  If your yearly income, is less than $75,000, keep going. We will help you complete the short form. 
  
  If your income is more than $75,000 a year, you need to use the Financial Statement long form.

question: |
  You need to use the long form Financial Statement
subquestion: |
  If your yearly income, before taxes, is $75,000  or more, you cannot use the Financial Statement short form.
  
  You need the Financial Statement [Long Form](https://www.mass.gov/info-details/probate-and-family-court-financial-statement-long-form-cjd-301l) and you should probably [talk to a lawyer](https://masslrf.org).

    * expenses,
    * debts and 'liabilities', and

    * Gas and electric bills, for the last 12 months.
    * Telephone bills, for the last 3 months.
